**Postal** is a complete and fully featured mail server for use by websites & web servers. Think Sendgrid, Mailgun or Postmark but open source and ready for you to run on your own servers. Postal is developed by [Krystal](https://k.io) to serve its own mail processing requirements and we have since decided that it should be released as an open source project for the community.

**Notice**
This is a fork of the original project since bug fixes and new features were apparantly no longer accepted or merged.  

**Features added / Bugs fixed**
- Support to search in E-Mail for part of the subject [#2]
- 5 Minute retry-delay instead of 4.5 [#3]
- Added a config option to disable suppression lists [#4]
